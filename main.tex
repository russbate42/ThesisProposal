\section{Introduction}
This article is a thesis proposal for a Doctorate of Philosophy from the
Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of British Columbia. My
thesis uses data from the ATLAS experiment, one of the four main experiments at
the Large
Hadron Collider at CERN.

For the past four years I have been working with the ATLAS experiment.

%% Maybe get rid of this altogether?

\section{The ATLAS Experiment}
The ATLAS experiment is a general purpose particle detector at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) at the European Center for Nuclear Physics Research (CERN). It
stands for \textbf{A} \textbf{T}oroidal \textbf{L}HC
\textbf{A}pparatu\textbf{S}.

\end{wrapfigure}
This is aptly named after the toroidal shaped magnet system which is integral to
the detector and our physics results. The design is such that it is a general
purpose particle detector designed to observe collisions from the full beam
energy and luminosity (a measure of number of collisions) of the LHC. As a
general purpose particle detector it is a composite of many different
subdetector systems, each with their own physics objectives in mind. Information
fro the many different subcomponents of the detector are recorded by

The amount of data our detector can observe exceeds the ability to record it.
This is one of the primary functions of the trigger system. This system is
designed to efficienctly make decisions of what events to record. This is done
in two stages, the level one trigger (L1), and the high level trigger (HLT).

\section{Research Contributions to ATLAS}

\subsection{Machine Learning for Pions}
My first research project within ATLAS as with the Machine Learning for Pions
project. At ATLAS, an inportant step in physics analysis is the reconstruction
of incident particle energy. One decay mechanism for a particle with some high
initial energy is to form energetic particle showers within the detector. Thus
with the primary goal in mind of reconstructing fundamental interactions, we
seek to accurately reconstruct the total energy of particle showers, henceforth
referred to as \textit{jets}. The Machine Learning for Pions project had a goal
of investigating if machine learning techniques could improve not only energy
reconstruction but also incident particle classification as well. This was done
with Pions due the fac tthat as a light hadron, they are produced in abundance
at the LHC and are a primary reconstruction object within a jet. This research
project was largely a success, demonstrating that deep learning was able to
better reconstruct energies of jet substructure elements when compared with the
standard technique used within ATLAS of Local Cell Weighting (LCW). Moreoever,
we were able to demonstrate the use of complimentary information from the
detector performed better than using this information on an individual basis.
See the appendix \ref{subfig:complimentarity} for the relevant plot.

\subsection{Time at CERN}
During my PhD I was given the opportunity to travel to the LHC and work on site
at CERN. This was a valuable opportunity to collaborate in person with
researchers from my team on various projects. In addition, I was able to take
part in underground visits to see the ATLAS detector in person. Beyond seeing
the detector in person, I was able to get trained and take shifts in the ATLAS
control room. My responsibilities involved two positions, the Run Controller,
and the Trigger Shifter. The Run controller is responsible for starting and
stopping data daking runs, and choosing which subcomponents of the detector are
involved in recording data. The trigger shifter is responsible for monitoring
data rates, CPU processing usage, and controlling which events we will record,
as dictated by the \textit{trigger menu}.

\subsection{Authorship Qualification Project}
Active collaborators with the ATLAS experiment must complete some task that is
needed by the experimental apparatus (or software) in order to qualify for
authorship on papers. For this task, I worked on studies related to an important
step in data processing called \textit{jet cleaning}. When we take data with
ATLAS, not all of the jets which we record are from the physics events we are
interested in. Jets which are reconstructed which are \textit{not} from
proton-proton collisions are referred to as \textit{fake jets}. There are three
main sources of fake jets. These are calorimetry noise, beam induced background
(BIB) or events from cosmic muons causing showers in the detector. In order to
remove these events, we make cuts based on intuitive physics. The strength of
cuts are fixed at given \textit{working points}. It was my task to investigate
if these cuts were working as expected for the newest software releases, and
characterize their performance. In addition, if possible these cuts were to be
improved upon.

The performance of these cuts were suitably characterized across the geometry of
the detector, as well as with respect to the transverse jet momentum.
Efficiencies were studied for all working points from data from both Run 2 and
Run 3 with Athena Release 22.

See \ref{fig:cleaning_performance_subfigure} for the full characterization.

The Higgs boson gives us a window to probe new physics from multiple
interpretations. There are two primary mechanisms that will be discussed.
However, this thesis intends to keep the search as general as possible such that
it is as model agnostic as possible. Unless there is a search for physics that
is extremely well motivated, it is always best to keep the search as model
agnostic as possible. The Higgs Boson is an interesting particle to do a model
agnostic search because there is such a rich ecosystem of physics beyond the
standard model that can (\textit{and should}) in principle couple to the higgs.
It is in the experimentalists best interests with respect to time and energy
investment to perform a search that can capture as much of this ecosystem as
possible. With that in mind, there is such an idea that has not yet been ruled
out experimentally and is very well motivated by one of the largest questions in
theoretical physics. That is, namely the \textit{big hierarchy problem}. As we
shall see, the phenomenology of such a model couples to the Higgs. Thus, as a
primary goal the aim is to search for the resulting particle.

The phenomenology in question is that of \textit{extra dimensions}. This idea is
not new, and in fact has been around for a long time, since the 1920s. There are
different, yet equally valid geometric configurations that one can come up with
in order to add dimensions. For simplicity, we will discuss 5-D goemetries where
we have four spatial dimensions and one of time. Extra dimensional models can of
course be extendid in the same way much beyond this but for now we will stick
with the simplest case.

The obvious extension is that of flat extra dimensions. Say more about flat
extra dimensions

A slightly more complex geometry is that of a curled extra dimension. The
important features of this model are that the four ``normal'' dimensional space
form flat Minkowski space, and the extra spatial dimension forms a closed loop.
This creates a closed boundary condition, which allow for resonances.

One new twist that has been added to this idea is that the dynamics are modified
as a parameter of the extra dimension. This was proposed by Lisa Randall and X
Sundrum, and is called the Randall-Sundrum geometry. There are two distinct
configurations of this geometry each with their own phenomenological
consequences. As we shall see from investigating the 5-D action potential, the
reasons for this being an interesting theory to investigate are twofold. For
one, it can provide a natural explanation for that hierarchy problem. That is,
why is gravity so weak in comparison to other forces? Also, we will see that
this model predicts resonant modes that are not evenly spaced out, but rather
bunched together closer to the standard model energies.

The five dimensional action potential can be expressed as the following
\begin{equation}
    S_{\text{Higgs}} = \int
    \dd[4]{x}\sqrt{-g^{(2)}} \left[g^{(2)\mu\nu}\pd_\mu\pd^\nu \right]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Boosted Topology}
Heavy particles will decay to highly energetic states due to mass energy
equivalence. For a di-Higgs state, this means each higgs will have high
momentum. The highest branching fraction for the higgs is approximately 57\% to
bottom quarks. Therefore, with the final state of two bottom quarks, the two b
quarks will subsequently have high momentum also. Thus, for a heavy resonant
search, we seek a topology with two bottom quarks kinematically favoring the
direction of the boosted higgs. At a certain energy, the b quark jets are highly
overlaping, and they are better reconstructed as a single large radius jet with
``two pronged'' topological characteristics. Jets selected for this purpose are
$R=1.0$ Unified Flow Object jets \ref{ufo_jets}.

\subsection{Xbb Tagging}
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figure2_GN2X_Tagger_PubNote}
    \caption{Performance of the Xbb tagger.}
    \label{fig:Xbb_tagger}
\end{figure}

For many physics objectives within ATLAS, it is important to identify
$H\rightarrow b\bar{b} / c\bar{c}$ processes. ATLAS has implemented the GN2X tagger
for identifying jets originating from such events. In the boosted regime, we use
the GN2X tagger for identifying large radius jets. The GN2X has been able to
identify a significant improvement over the previous approach. The previous
approach used flavour tagging discriminants of individual track-based subjets in
a basic feed forward neural net.  Contrast this to the GN2X which builds upon
previous results of Graph Neural Net (GNN) networks to tag and calibrate small
radius jets, and adds transformer architecture. In addition there are some
variations that have been explored combining tracks, subjets, and large R jet
calorimetry constituents to increase the performance.

GN2X is trained with the goal of classifying large radius jets based on their
origin, that is to discriminate $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}/c\bar{c}$ from background
processes that could produce jets of a similar structure (and substructure).
Backgrounds considered in training were just two - multijet and fully hadronic
top quark decays. Examples of some substructure elements that the tagger would
``learn'' are topological characteristics such as displaced secondary tracks for
b-jets. In addition it may observe the two-pronged nature of the large radius
jet, as it is composed of two smaller sub-jets. Subjects within the large radius
jet are defined with a variable radius clustering algorithm
\cite{jet_substructure}.

The three main samples used in training are for the signal and two backgrounds.
For the H jet signal, \textit{associated Z production} higgs samples were
produced. That is, we have $q\bar{q}\rightarrow ZH, Z\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$.
For top quark jet backgrounds, the process $Z'\rightarrow t\bar{t}$ is used.
Multijet is simply produced in the standard QCD multijet production within
ATLAS. One difficulty of this training, is that with a standard Higgs
production, we will have a distribution centered at $125 \text{GeV}$, and any
neural network will simply adjust the weights and biases to select the 125 GeV
sample. To overcome this, the phase space sampling is biased such that the
tagger is trained on a flat mass distribution. This becomes of utmost importance
when GN2X is performing simultaneous mass regression for the jet mass
calibration. However, when it comes to evaluation of the network, a separate
sample of associated higgs production is used with H set to $125 \text{GeV}$ and
a smooth, exponentially falling distribution for $p_T$.

For the signal sample, associated ZH Higgs production is used. For top quark
backgrounds, a $Z'$ production is used. Finally, for multijet the standard ATLAS
QCD multijet production is used. Productions are summarized in the following
table.
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ c c }
        \noalign{\vskip0pt}\hline\noalign{\vskip3pt}
        $H(b\bar{b}/c\bar{c})$ & $q\bar{q} \rightarrow ZH,\; Z \rightarrow
        \mu^+\mu^-$ \\ 
        Top & $Z' \rightarrow t\bar{t}$ \\
        Multijet & Multijet \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Samples processed using the full production chain for detector simulation, using
\cite{geant4} and ATLAS Athena software \cite{atlas_simulation}. Pileup is
simulated by overlaying hard scattering events with inelastic collisions
\cite{boosted_hbbcc_tagger}. Signal production composed of 62 million jets in
total. $15$ million each for $H(b\bar{b}/c\bar{c})$, $10$ million Top jets, and
$22$ million multijets.

UFO Jets merge Particle Flow \cite{pflow_jets} objects with Track Calo Clusters
\cite{calo_clusters_performance}. This is a combination of neutral and charged
components, in order to optimize performance for different physics objects
across a wide range of $p_T$. Pileup, and other contributions were removed with
grooming algorithms; soft-drop \cite{soft_drop}, constituent subtraction
\cite{pileup_subtraction}[?], and soft-killer \cite{softkiller}. The jet
selections applied are summarized in the following table.

    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ c c c c }
        \noalign{\vskip0pt}\hline\noalign{\vskip3pt}
        & Energy & Jet Mass & $|\eta|$ \\
        Training & $200\;\text{GeV} \rightarrow 1.5\;\text{TeV}$ &
        $50\;\text{GeV} < m_J < 300\;\text{GeV}$ (flat) & $< 2.0$ \\ 
        Evaluation & $250\;\text{GeV} \rightarrow 1.5\;\text{TeV}$ &
        $50\;\text{GeV} < m_J < 200\;\text{GeV}$ & $< 2.0$ \\

    \caption{Traning and evaluation summary for input jets \cite{boosted_hbbcc_tagger}.}
    \label{tab:jets_training}
\end{table}

Truth information is recorded from the generator level. It is a requirement that
the large radius jets have a ghost associated Higgs. Similarly for the top quark
background, any $t\bar{t}$ particle that decay hadronically that have a ghost
association are kept.

Training inputs are mostly composed of tracking variables. However, three
large-R jet variables are considered - $p_T, \eta, m_J$. $20$ track variables
associated with each track are considered, and for each jet, up to $100$ tracks
are considered.

GN2X uses a similar architecture to deep set neural networks CITE for pre-processing
of the track vectors. That is, track variables have initializer networks which
embed the tracking information as a higher dimensional vector. Variants were
explored where different inputs have different initializer networks. This higher
dimensional embedding is a $192$ dimensional space. Crucially, what sets apart
the performance of GN2X from previous ML models, is the learnable aggregation.
This is architecture that uses information from the embedded dimension, to
optimize important features for global message passing, and aggregation. This is
done with transformer-encoder architecture. GN2X was build with 6 encoder and 4
attention layers. Heterogeneous models which do not differentiate between input
variants use the same attention mechanism for all inputs, and this significantly
reduces the overall model parameter size \cite{boosted_hbbcc_tagger}.

The output of these networks is probability distributions for given tagging
category. The efficiency of the tagger is defined as the number of correctly
identified $H(bb)$ jets over all $H(bb)$ jets. The descriminant for the tagger
is defined as
\begin{equation}
    D^{GN2X}_{Hbb} = \ln \left( \frac{p_{Hbb}}{ f_{Hcc}p_{Hcc} +
    f_{top}p_{top} + ( 1 - f_{Hcc} - f_{top} )p_{QCD} } \right)
\end{equation}
$f_{top},\;f_{Hcc}$ are parameters allowed to float in order to control the
relative weights of each process. For the final results, weights of these
parameters are set to $f_{Hcc} = 0.02, \; f_{top} = 0.25$ arbitrarily.

The final results are shown in \ref{fig:Xbb_tagger}. Accross the whole spectrum
of tagging efficiencies the GN2X outperforms the previous tagging algorithm with
respect to the number of backgrounds rejected. This is computed for the two main
sources of background - Top quark and QCD multijet. If the results are
normalized to the previous benchmark - the simple feed-forward DNN, we are able
to see the increased ratio of the background rejection for the new algorithm.
From the QCD multijet backgorund, we see an approximately constant rejection of
$2.5$ accross the spectrum of efficiencies. For Top quark rejection, we see a
maximum at approximately $2.1$ at $.7$ tagging efficiency, with a slow decrease on either
side. We know that QCD is the dominant background, and this background rejection
matters more. Given the increase in overall tagging efficiency, adding the GN2X
to our analysis should yield more sensitive results than previos analysis.

\vspace{10pt}
DEPRECATED
For tagging signal and discriminating background we use the state of the art
GN2X tagger. This is a multi-headed attention network. GN2X\* is trained on
truth boosted Xbb jets. Therefore in principle the truth information that the
network is exposed to has the two-pronged topology. This tagger also learns the
truth jet reconstructed mass and energy. A flaw 

Finally, the results are such that accross the whole spectrum of working points
for $H(b\bar{b})$ tagging efficiency, the GN2X algorithm outputforms the
previous iterations of taggers. Namely the $D_Xbb$, which is simply the feed
forward neural net. The final results are summarized in Figure \ref{}

\appendix{Derivation of RS Model}
\section{Dynamics in Four Dimensions}
First let use make some fundamental observations about allowing for extra
dimensions. Momentum in a five (or higher) dimensional spacetime can show up as
extra mass in four-space. 
\begin{align}
    E = \sqrt{\vb{p}^2 + p_5^5 + m^2} \\
    E = \sqrt{\vb{p}^2 + m_{KK}}
\end{align}
We make the definition that $x^5 = (x^\mu,x^5)$ where $(M = 0-3,5)$. For
compactfied extra dimensions (curled, closed) we confine $x^5 \equiv \gamma$ to
the interval $0 \leq \gamma < 2\pi R$. Also we consider that the geometry is
periodic in nature and therefore scalar fields will obey the following
\begin{equation}
    \phi(x, \gamma + 2\pi R) = \phi (x,\gamma)
\end{equation}
With a simple five dimensional metric, we consider the space-time element is the
following
\begin{equation}
    \dd{s}^2 = \eta_{MN}\dd{X}^M\dd{X}^N = \eta_{\nu\mu}\dd{x}^\mu\dd{x}^\nu -
    \dd{\gamma}^2
\end{equation}
where we have used the metric signature $\nu_{MN} = (1,-1,-1,-1,-1)$.
We can define the action for a 5-D scalar with no mass to be the following
\begin{align}
    S^{5-D} &= \int \dd[5]{X} \left( \frac{1}{2} \pd_M \Phi(X) \pd^M
    \Phi(X) \right) \\
        S^{5-D} &= \int \dd[4]{x} \int^{2\pi R}_{0} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \pd_\mu \Phi(x,\gamma) \pd^\mu
    \Phi(x,\gamma) + \pd_\gamma \Phi(x,\gamma) \pd^\gamma
    \Phi(x,\gamma) \right]
\end{align}
Based on the boundary conditions, we know that the field will be periodic and we
can therefore expand any wavefunciton as a fourier series
\begin{align}
    \Phi(x,\gamma) &= \frac{1}{s\pi R} \sum^{+\infty}_{n=-\infty}
    \varphi^{n}(x)e^{in\gamma /R} \\
                   &= \frac{1}{2\pi R} \Phi^{(0)}(x) + \frac{1}{\pi R}
                   \sum^{+\infty}_{n=-\infty} \left[
                       \phi^{+(n)}(x)\cos\left( \frac{n\gamma}{R} \right) +
               \phi^{+(n)}(x)\sin\left( \frac{n\gamma}{R} \right) \right]
\end{align}
Imposing the condition that the field $\Phi$ must be real, means that
$\phi^{(-n)} = \phi^{(n)\dagger}$. We can define the field
\begin{equation}
    \phi^{(\pm n)}(n > 0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \phi^{(+n)} \pm i\phi^{(-n)} \right)
\end{equation}
If we combine these equations, we are left with an \textit{effective} 4-D action
\begin{align}
    S^{(4D)} &= \int \dd[4]{x} \frac{1}{2} \left\{ \sum_n \left[
    \pd_\mu\phi^{(-n)}\pd^\mu\phi^{(n)} - \frac{n^2}{R^2}\phi^{(-n)}\phi^{(n)}
\right] \right\} \\
             &= \int \dd[4]{x} \frac{1}{2} \left\{
                 \pd_\mu\phi^{(0)}\pd^\mu\phi^{(0)} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left[
    \pd_\mu\phi^{(\pm n)}\pd^\mu\phi^{(\pm n)} - \frac{n^2}{R^2}\phi^{(\pm
    n)}\phi^{(\pm n)}
\right] \right\} \\
\end{align}
In 4-D, we have acquired a term
\begin{equation}
    \frac{n^2}{R^2}\phi^{(\pm n)}\phi^{(\pm n)}
\end{equation}
This behaves exactly like an extra mass term in four-space. Interestingly, if we
add extra compactified dimensions, we get more mass terms. For every n, we see a
mass resonance. Note that the scale of the mass depends on the geometry of the
compactified extra dimensions. Suppose we have a scalar with mass $m$. Then we
have $$m^2 = m_0^2 + \frac{n_5^2}{R_5^2}$$. Notice that for large $\frac{n}{R}$
we will have no access to observe these terms. The possible mass terms that are
accessible with accelerator energies depend on $\frac{n}{R}$.

\section{RS1}
We start with the effective four dimensional higgs action
\begin{equation}
    S_{Higgs} = \int \dd[4]{x}\sqrt{-g^{(2)}} \left[ g^{(2)\mu \nu} \pd_\mu H
    \pd_\nu H - \lambda \left( |H|^2 - v_0^2 \right)^2 \right]
\end{equation}
where we have used the following relationship with the metric
\begin{equation}
    g^{(2)}_{\mu\nu} = e^{-2k\pi R}g^(0)_{\mu\nu}, g^{(2)} = \text{det}
    g_{\mu\nu}^(2) = (e^{-2\pi k R})^4g^{(0)} = e^{-8\pi kR}g^{(0)}
\end{equation}
$g^(2)_\mu\nu$ is the gravitational interaction term with (in this case) the
higgs, but could also be extended to any SM particle. For this to work, assume
that the $4-D$ higgs and the standard model are at the $\gamma = \pi R$ brane.
When $\gamma$, this approaches the Planck or UV brane. At $\pi R$, we have the
IR brane. Expanding the above term, we are left with
\begin{equation}
    S_{Higgs} = \int \dd[4]{x} \sqrt{-g^(0)} \left[ e^{-2k\pi R} g^{(0)} \pd_\mu
    H \pd_\nu H - e^{-4k\pi R} \lambda (|H|^2 - v_0^2 )^2 \right]
\end{equation}
Again we have used the above relationship with $g^{(2)}$. Here we can
renormalize the higgs such that $H = \hat{H}e^{k\pi R}$. We are now left with
\begin{equation}
    S_{Higgs} = \int \dd[4]{x} \sqrt{-g^(0)} \left[ g^{(0)} \pd_\mu
    \hat{H} \pd_\nu \hat{H} - e^{-4k\pi R} \lambda (|\hat{H}|^2 - v_0^2 )^2 \right]
\end{equation}
Through this renormalization, something remarkable has happened. The bare vacuum
expectation value of the higgs gets renormalized to the physical vev by the warp
factor, that is
\begin{equation}
    v \equiv e^{-k\pi R}v_0
\end{equation}

\section{RS2}
In the RS2 scenario, we can show that the ``compactification'' of the extra
dimension need not be constrained to a finite radius and thus finite volume.
This scenario has a different setup, that the IR brane is located at $\pi R$,
and $\gamma = 0$ for the Planck Brane. The following steps will demonstrate that
the KK towers are pushed off to infinity.
Consider the 0 mode, which does not depend on the usual parametrization of the
space-time coordinate $\gamma$. This is the same as stating that the zero mode
does not depend on the radius $R$ explicitly.
\begin{align}
    S_5 &= \frac{\bar{M}_5^3}{2} \int \dd[4]{x} \int^{\pi R}_{-\pi R}
    \dd{\gamma} \sqrt{-G}R^{(5)} \\
    &= \frac{\bar{M}_5^3}{2} \int \dd[4]{x} \int^{\pi R}
    \dd{\gamma} \sqrt{-g}[AR^{(4)} + ...] = S_{4 eff} + ...\\
\end{align}
Where we express the Ricci curvature in 5-D and 4-D as $R^{(5)}, R^{(4)}$
respectively. The 5D Ricci curvature can be expressed as
\begin{align}
    R^{(5)} &= G^{MN}R_{MN} = G^{MN}R^K_{MKN} = G[ \pd_M \Gamma^K_{KN} + ... ] \\
            &= G^{MN}[ \pd_M \{ G^{KL}( \pd_L G_{MN} + ... ) + ... \} ]
\end{align}
Where we have expressed the Riumann curvature tensors and Christoffel
connection in 5-D as $R^J_{MKN}$ and $\Gamma^J_{KN}$. Only $M,N = \mu\nu$
contribute to $R^{(4)}$ and terms with $M,N=5$ contribute after integration.

The result of this integral is
\begin{align}
    16\pi G_N &= \frac{2}{\bar{M}_{Pl}^2} = \frac{1}{\bar{M}^3_5} \frac{2k}{1 -
    e^{-2k\pi R}} \\
    \implies \bar{M}^2_{Pl} &= \frac{\bar{M}^3_5}{k} (1 - e^{-2k\pi R})
\end{align}
What we see from this result is that even if we extend the radius out to
infinity, we have a well defined Planck mass. Thus we have a coherent physical
theory with extra dimensions of infinite volume. 

\section{Gravitons in Extra Dimensions}
The gravitational wave equation $h_{MN}$ is the same for massless 5-D scalar
except for the normalization factor.
\begin{align}
    S_{5-Scalar} &= \frac{1}{2} \int \dd[4]{x} \int \dd \gamma \sqrt{-G} G^{MN}
    \pd_M \Phi \pd_N \Phi \\
                 &= \frac{1}{2} \int \dd[4]{x} \int \dd \gamma
                 e^{-4\sigma(\gamma)} \sqrt{-g} \left[ e^{2\sigma(x)} \pd_\mu
                 \Phi \pd^\nu \Phi - ( \pd_\gamma \Phi \pd^\gamma \Phi ) \right]
    \pd_M \Phi \pd_N \Phi \\
\end{align}
For now, we only look at the zero mode. This means we only focus on the first
term in the integral. In addition, we require the boundary condition that
$\pd\Phi(x,\gamma)=0$ at $\gamma=0, \pi R$. This is the same as imposing Neumann
boundary conditions for an open ended string. If we expand $\Phi$ in the KK
tower, that is
\begin{equation}
    \Phi(x,\gamma) = \sum_{n\neq 0} \psi_n(x) \varphi_n (\gamma) \\
    (\pd_\mu \pd^\mu + m_n^2) \psi_n(x) = 0
\end{equation}
Where the second requirement is simply a statement that each mass tower
satisfies the equation for a free massive scalar. Now, for our 5-Scalar action
\begin{equation}
    S_{5-Scalar} = \frac{1}{2} \int \dd[4]{x} \int^{\pi R}_{\pi R} \dd \gamma
    e^{-2\sigma} \Phi \left[ -m^2 \pd_\mu \pd^\mu \right] \Phi 
\end{equation}
It can be shown, see reference \ref{522}, that this leads to the following
potential
\begin{equation}
    V(z) = \frac{15k^2}{8(k|z|+1)^2} - \frac{3}{2}k\left[ \delta(z) - \delta(z -
    z_i) \right]
\end{equation}
The resonant modes solving this potential are shown in Figure
\ref{subfig:RSG_resonant_modes}.
